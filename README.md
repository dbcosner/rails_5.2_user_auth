# User auth From Scratch in Rails 5.2

A very simple Rails application to learn about building user auth from scratch.

Built following the instructions here: https://www.sitepoint.com/rails-userpassword-authentication-from-scratch-part-i/

I ended up using [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) for my [personal site](https://drewcosner.com).
